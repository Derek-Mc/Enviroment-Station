# Enviroment-Station
Keystone project from college.

The objective of the project was to create an enviromantal monitoring station that would measure the humidity, light levels,
temperature, and soil moisture content of a plant.  This data is then sent to a server where the data is the pulled from and
displayed on an Android app and a website.
