# Enviroment-Station
Keystone project from college (2017).

The objective of the project was to create an enviromantal monitoring station that would measure the humidity, light levels,
temperature, and soil moisture content of a plant.  This data is then sent to a server where the data is the pulled from and
displayed on an Android app and a website.

All files were made by myself with the exception of; Plant1.php, Plant_One_Hum.php, Plant_One_Light.php, Plant_One_Moist.php,
and Plant_One_Temp.php, which were created by my partner on the project.
